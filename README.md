## This is a simple shell I built while using tutorials in order to learn C.
## If you are new to coding, and would like to use this as a reference, please feel free. It is fully open-source under MIT meaning you may change the code as you please. Forks and Pull Requests are welcome, I would love to move towards a more complex custom shell.


## WARNING: THIS SHELL CANNOT AND WILL NOT BOOT YOUR SYSTEM. DO NOT SET IT AS YOUR DEFAULT SHELL FOR SOME REASON
ask me how i know... im thinking i might be dumb.
